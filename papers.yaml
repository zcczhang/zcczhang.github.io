    description: We present PoliFormer, an RGB-only indoor navigation agent trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning at scale. It is trained for hundreds of millions of interactions across diverse environments, leveraging parallelized, multi-machine rollouts for efficient training with high throughput. It is a masterful navigator, producing SoTA results across two distinct embodiments and four navigation benchmarks. PoliFormer can also be trivially extended to a variety of downstream applications such as object tracking, multi-object navigation, and open-vocabulary navigation in the real world with no finetuning.

    description: We present Unified-IO 2, the first autoregressive multimodal model that is capable of understanding and generating images, text, audio, and action. A single model trained from scratch that comprehends text, video, and audio; performs 2D/3D detection, referring expression, pose estimation, point tracking; generates or edits images and audio/music; predicts segmentation, depth, surface normal, optical flow; navigates and manipulates in embodied space with multimodal prompts; view synthesis in 3D... and so much more!

                  across both simulated and real-robot environments for long-horizon visual manipulation tasks, without any task-specific knowledge or training. 
                  UVD discovered subgoals enable effective reward shaping for
                  solving challenging multi-stage tasks using RL, and policies
                  trained with IL exhibit significantly superior compositional
                  generalization at test time."

  #   description: In this work, a finite element code was used for the design, optimization and visualization of a comb drive accelerator. In the simulation results, the post-optimization design has high performance in high frequency oscillation operating environment. The optimization is based on the ideal eigenfre-quency and Nelder-Mead method. The 3-D working conditions are realized by testing and comparing the time and frequency domain of pre-optimized and optimized design whose frequency ranges from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz. Finally, the electric potential and capacitance in comb drive are visualized, which shows the better electric signals and displacements.
